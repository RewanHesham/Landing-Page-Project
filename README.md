# Landing Page Project

## Description
    *In this project i am building a muli-section landing page.
    *It contains 5 sections, each section could be accessed from the navigation bar.
    *The navigational menu is dynamically updated based on the number of sections that is added to the page.
    *Each section is set to active class when it's selected from the navigation menu items or navigated on the screen.
    *During the active class the background of the section is different from the inactive section.
    *When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls to the appropriate section.
    *The selected section item is set to active in the navigation menu bar.
    *When the user reaches the bottom of the page there is a top button to scroll back to the top of the page.
